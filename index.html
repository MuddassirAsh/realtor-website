                            Ash Choudhry, a realtor, immigration consultant, and ex personal banker,
                            who dreamed of living in Canada one day, just like you.
                            Like many other Canadians, I too aspired for the Canadian dream. I immigrated to Canada from Pakistan in 2007. 
                            I bought my first house in Ajax, Ontario in 2008.
                            I understand the struggles of the new Canadian, be it financial insecurity, language bariers, and job prospects. 
                            Let me guide you through the whole process of finding the right path for you to make Canada your home by 
                            tailoring my service to fit your needs.
                            <br/></br>
                            As a Right At Home Real Estate professional, 
                            I am dedicated to providing you with the highest quality service possible. My personal knowledge 
                            of the local Real Estate market is combined with the power of the Right at Home brand - 
                            the most emerging name in Real Estate today. Let me assist you in finding your dream home, 
                            in a neighbourhood that is right for you, and in the price range you want. 
                            Or if you are interested in selling a property, I also have the expertise to help you get the fastest 
                            sale possible and at the best price. 
                        </p>

                                Getting a rental place is very daunting, particularly when you want a nice land lord and a desired location/community, but Ash from Right at Home went above and beyond in helping me and my partner search for housing.<br><br>
